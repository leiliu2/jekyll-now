#### 2. How to build a website with [a fork](https://github.com/Leiliu1/jekyllforphd) (github page)

This is a static site genterater modified from [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for skillz hour demostration.

a. Steps

- register github account (if you do not have one already)
- fork [here](https://github.com/Leiliu1/jekyllforphd)
- play!

b. A quick to-do list to get you started

- read _readme_ (always a good place to start :)
- change site info in **_config.yml**
- change page-name in **page-name.md**
- add news in **/_posts/**

c. Notes

- to change pages, go to _name-of-the-page.md_
- to change homepage layout, go to index.html
- to change which pages to show, go to /_layouts/default.html
- this [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) might be helpful


### 2. How to build a website with [SB You](https://you.stonybrook.edu/)

a. Steps

- Log in
- Play!

### 3. Concluding remarks

a. github vs. SB You

||Github|SB You|
|---|---|---|
|pros|fully customizable|WYSIWYG|
|cons|somewhat steep learning curve|not as geeky|

b. other (free) alternatives

- [Github page](https://pages.github.com/)
    + more basic stuff that powers our jekyll-based site generator
- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/?ref=footer_custom_svg)
    + very similar to SB You
-  and [many more](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+build+a+personal+website)

c. domain names

- check out [here](https://www.godaddy.com/) and [here](https://www.namecheap.com/)
- domains using one's name is (I think) a common practice, but see [here](http://www.phonologist.org/) :)
- try to avoid stuff like [bigsyntax.guru](https://www.godaddy.com/dpp/find?checkAvail=1&tmskey=&domainToCheck=bigsyntax.guru)
